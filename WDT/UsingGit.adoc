* *Window > Show View > Other*
* Type `git` in the filter box, and select *Git Repositories*
2. Copy the Github repo URL from the field under *HTTPS clone URL* on the right-hand-side of the Github 
repository's webpage and copy the https github URL.
3. In the Git Repositories view in Eclipse, click the hyperlink *Clone a Git repository*.
4. The Git repo location details should be filled in automatically from the clipboard.  Select *Next > Next > Finish*.
5. The repo should appear in the Git Repositories view.
